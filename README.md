# Salesforce Search
My [Salesforce Search](https://www.raycast.com/sven/salesforce) extension for [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) allows you to search for accounts, contacts, opportunities, dashboards and reports and optionally additional (custom) objects in Salesforce and open them in the browser.
